#üîÅ Problem: Count the Vowels in a Word
# Description:
# Write a Python program that asks the user to enter a word (a string), and then counts how many vowels are in that word.
# Vowels are: a, e, i, o, u (both lowercase and uppercase should be counted).

vowels = ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u", "A", "E", "I", "O", "U"]
word = str(input("Enter a word or phrase:"))
characters = len(word)
position = 0
Number_of_vowels = 0
character = ()

while position < len(word):
    character = str(word[position])
    if character in vowels:
       Number_of_vowels = Number_of_vowels + 1
    position = position + 1

print(f"The number of vowels in '{word}' is: {Number_of_vowels}")
