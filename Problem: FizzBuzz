# ðŸ”¢ Problem: FizzBuzz
# Description:
# Write a Python program that asks the user to enter a number N, and then prints the numbers from 1 to N. But:
# For numbers that are divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
# For numbers that are divisible by 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
# For numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".
# Otherwise, just print the number.

Number = int(input("Enter a number:"))
for x in range(1,Number+1):
    if x % 3 == 0 and x % 5 ==0:
       print("FizzBuzz")
    elif x % 3 == 0:
       print("Fizz")
    elif x % 5 == 0:
       print("Buzz")
    else:
       print(x)
