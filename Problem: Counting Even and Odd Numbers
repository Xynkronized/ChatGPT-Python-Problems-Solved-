#Problem: Counting Even and Odd Numbers
#Write a Python program that:
#Asks the user how many numbers they want to enter.
#Lets the user enter that many numbers (one at a time).
#Counts how many of those numbers are even and how many are odd.
#Prints the total count of evens and odds at the end.

entry = int(input("How many numbers will you enter?:"))
count = 0
odd_numbers = 0
even_numbers = 0
while count < entry:
    ask = int(input("Enter a number:"))
    count += 1
    if ask % 2 == 0:
        even_numbers += 1
    else:
        odd_numbers += 1
print(f"You entered {even_numbers} even numbers and {odd_numbers} odd numbers.")
